      <p>This visualization displays the developmental level classification that UNICEF has assigned to each country. The countries represented are only the countries that UNICEF has education data for, and therefore are the only countries that will be analyzed in this project. UNICEF explains its classification process as "Economies are currently divided into four income groupings: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. Income is measured using gross national income (GNI) per capita, in U.S. dollars, converted from local currency using the World Bank Atlas method.</p>
      <div class='my-5'></div>
      <h2 id="School Rates">Comparing Attendance, Completion, and Out-of-School Rates</h2>
      <p>The data visualizations below are created using a combination of data from three separate UNICEF datasets: one on net attendance rates per country, one on school completion rates per country, and one on out-of-school rates per country. Each data-set is also split up by grade level (Primary, Lower Secondary, and Upper Secondary). For each grade level, the data sets compare the percentage rates of female and males in each country that attend school, complete school, or are out of school. They also compare the rates for school children within five separate wealth quintiles (categorized by UNICEF as Poorest, Second, Middle, Fourth, or Richest). The visualizations plot attendance rates and completion rates against each other, differentiating between gender or wealth level in order to compare and identify disparities. The color of the points identify which region the country is a part of and by hovering on each point, the country name is displayed. The visualizations also allow comparisons to be made between the rates for each grade level. Second, there are visualizations displaying out of school rates for each country on a map with the color displaying the percentage rate. The country name can be displayed by hovering over each country. These maps allow comparisons to be made between out of school rates for each gender, wealth level, and grade levels.

      <h2 id="Learning Skills">Foundational Learning Skills</h2>
      <p>For this dataset, UNICEF calculated the percentage of children in two different age groups (children in Grades 2/3 and children aged 7 to 14) who demonstrated foundational reading skills and the percentage of children in the same two different age groups (children in Grades 2/3 and children aged 7 to 14) who demonstrated foundational numeracy skills. These values were collected from a set of countries in particular regions specified below. In the following visualizations, the percentage of children who demonstrated foundational reading skills is plotted against the percentage of children who demonstrated foundational numeracy skills for a given country. The plotted values are distinguished by color to signify the region the data is from. In the first visualization, the values are separated into two scatterplots to group the data by gender. In the second visualization, the values are separated into five scatterplots to group the data by wealth quintile.</p>
